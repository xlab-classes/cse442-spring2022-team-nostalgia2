To use the website, please pull the code from the GitHub and use XAMPP to run the website. As of 5/20/22, the Cheshire deployed code has issues with registration, but this is not present in the localhost version of our website.

After cloning our repo, run XAMPP and click Start on the Apache row. If you aren't on the UBNetwork, please us Cisco AnyConnect and sign in with your UB Credentials. Afterwards, authenticate with the Duo app and accept the connection. The SQL connection will now work without any issue.
